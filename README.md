# Capstone Project: Full-Stack Application

## About

Cup O' Sugar is a 'shareconomy' application that allows users post items online and share them with their neighbors. The app is meant to foster community, provide a resource for those in need and possibly prevent unnecessary consumerism.

## Features

* User Authentication: sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and change password
* Create and view all or own items.
* Edit and delete own items.

## Technologies Used

* Front-end: HTML/SCSS/Sass, Javascript, Bootstrap, AJAX, Ember.js
* Back-end: Ruby on Rails

## Development Process

Since this was my first time using Ember, I started off by experimenting and
structuring the app according my understanding and trying to keep everything as
simple as possible. However, after starting to work, I was running into a lot
of errors and felt that my approach was not actually compatible with Ember.
After having a discussion with my instructor, a lot of things became clearer to
me, and I felt more confident in my understanding of how Ember likes to
communicate with APIs and what it expects. After re-structuring parts of the
app, things went a lot smoother and it was easier to navigate around and find
the answers to my questions/issues.

My general approach was to build out the Rails backend first and test all of the
endpoints. Then, I went to the frontend and began working on Ember. I tackled
one view state at a time and depending on the purpose, would develop components
for data and actions belonging to each route. Lastly, I worked on organizing
the layout and the styling of the app before deploying.


## Unsolved Problems and Next Steps

* Add google maps API to show item location
* Protect identity of users for item contact (via simple message or mail relay system)
